# Network-Analysis
Sorry if this is late. I just got back from travelling today. I attempted to use Gephi-lite but had issues uploading the data. Network Navigator was the most successful. I used Melanie Walsh’s “Marvel” dataset. Here was the information from Walsh’s data which contains 327 characters:

“...network data for character relationships within the Marvel comic book universe (beginning in 1961 and ending around 1999/2000?), which was originally compiled by Cesc Rosselló, Ricardo Alberich, and Joe Miro from Russ Chappell's Marvel Chronology Project*, a database that catalogues every appearance by every significant character in the Marvel comic book universe. This network data was originally used and analyzed by Rosselló, Alberich, and Miro in "Marvel Universe looks almost like a real social network."

The point of this dataset is to identify crossovers in the Marvel universe.
